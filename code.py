# Step 5: Comedy generator function
def generate_comedy(prompt=None, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1):

    results = generator(prompt, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=num_return_sequences, do_sample=True, temperature=0.9)
    return [res['generated_text'] for res in results]

# Step 6: Interactive generation
prompt = input("Enter your comedy prompt (or press Enter for a random one): ").strip()
if prompt == "":
    prompt = random.choice(comedy_prompts)
